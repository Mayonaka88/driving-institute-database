# Driving Institute Database
> A database for a mock driving institute created in 2021 as a project for my SQL introductory course in the British University in Dubai.

> SQL was used in this project.

> The program represents a database for a driving institute with tables for students, branches, facilities, vehicles, instructors, and thier respective relationships.

> The database is not well constructed as it was my first proper attemp at creating a database using SQL.
